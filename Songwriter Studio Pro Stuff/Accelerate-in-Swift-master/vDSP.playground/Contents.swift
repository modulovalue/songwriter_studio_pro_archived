## Example 1: Create a nice ramp of data
- Note: Despite many places in functions where it looks like you should be able to just pop a number in there, often you have to send in the variable as a reference, as with the **start** and **increment** numbers below. Option-clicking the function in Xcode will show which items need to be references, typed as some kind of pointer.
- Note: As with most functions in the Accelerate framework, functions do not return anything. You pass in a reference to a _var_ variable and go from there.

/*:
## Example 2: Absolute values
- Note: The **length** is always required to be of **vDSP_Length** type, as so you need to cast it. This used to be the case with strides as well, but now we can just put a nice **1** in there. Perhaps some day we can do that with lengths. That said, this does prevent us from mixing up items passed to the functions, arguments very easily mixed up.
